                Pressing the item button without an item honks your horn. Can be customized with the command below, otherwise it's random every race.<br>

                   The server uses <a href="https://mb.srb2.org/addons/advance-tricks.3015/">Advance Tricks</a> so pressing the brake key in the air performs a trick. This sends you launching forward when not pressing another key, but your trick depends on your input while pressing the brake key.<br>
