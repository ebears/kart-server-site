                <h3>ü•≥ Gameplay</h3>
                <p>Pressing the item button without an item honks your horn. Can be customized with the command below, otherwise it's random every race.<br>
                <br>
                   The server uses <a href="https://mb.srb2.org/addons/advance-tricks.3015/">Advance Tricks</a> so pressing the brake key in the air performs a trick. This sends you launching forward when not pressing another key, but your trick depends on your input while pressing the brake key.<br>

                <h3>üèÜ Ranked System</h3>
                <p><b>When playing on the server solo</b> - choose your favourite maps and race them solo for new time records! A leaderboard of everyone on the server and their time is displayed in an arcade style.
                You can collect +25 to your rank (explained below) for completing a track solo.<br>
                <br>
                <b>When playing with muliple people</b> - the ranked system comes alive. Gain or lose ranks based on how you place after each race. Ranks are distributed after each race depending on the rank of each of the racers. Low ranked players gain more from beating high ranked players and lose less when losing against them.
                New players start with a rank of 1500. The rank breakpoints are:<br>
                    <br>
                    Rookie - 1<br>
                    Wood - 500<br>
                    Bronze - 1,500<br>
                    Silver - 2,000<br>
                    Gold - 3,000<br>
                    Platinum - 4,000<br>
                    Diamond - 5,000<br>
